### Wayland

The way `Pict3D` interacts with `racket-gui` uses assumptions based on X11
(e.g., that an OpenGL context will still exist after a window is hidden).
However, Wayland handles OpenGL contexts more strictly, and hiding a window can
invalidate the context, causing a crash.

To circumvent this issue, you can force the application to run under XWayland by
setting the environment variable `GDK_BACKEND=x11`. This reverts GTK to use X11,
which better matches the assumptions `Pict3D` makes.

Weâ€™ve included a helper script, `setup-xwayland.sh`, in the root directory for
convenience:

```sh
source ./setup-xwayland.sh
```
