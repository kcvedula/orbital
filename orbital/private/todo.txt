1. syntax for carbon templates and cyclic pi systems, as well as syntax for
modifying existing templates. keep this in templates-and-substituents-stx.rkt or
templates-and-substituents.rkt

2. fill a file called mol-builder which requires everything from templates and
substituents files and also defines constants. Fill it with real examples of
curated molecules showing off different functional groups. 

3. start testing the runtime layer and syntax layer ONLY, forget about any tests
for rendering, babel, and pubchem until the very end. 

4. start a racket package, clean up git, rename files, etc, make a main, and
start documentation.

3d rendering from all different types
- template -> hydroginate (make sure there are hydrogens)
- 

Benefits:
- deal with obabel
- create pict3d
- extensible (use mol or template)
